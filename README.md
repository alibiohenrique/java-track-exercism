## About Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is an online platform designed to help you improve your coding skills through practice and mentorship. It offers a wide range of programming tracks, including Java, to help you hone your skills and become a better developer.

## Repository Structure



This repository is organized by weeks, and each week's solutions are contained within its own folder. The structure of the repository is as follows:
